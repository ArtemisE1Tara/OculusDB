                <h2>Important info</h2>
                OculusDB is currently experiencing issues:
                <br>
                <br>
                Due to a bug in Oculus authentication I'm making OculusDB unavailable for now to prevent piracy. I apologise for any inconvenience caused by this.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>When will OculusDB be up again?</h2>
                At this point in time I do not know. I'll try to open OculusDB as soon as possible. This could be in a few minutes, hours or more than a day.
